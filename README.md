# fake-news-detection-using-LSTM
This project aims to detect fake news using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to classify news articles as either Fake or Real, and provides a web interface using Streamlit for interactive user input.

ðŸ§  Model Architecture

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.
LSTM Layer: Learns sequence patterns from text.
Dropout Layer: Reduces overfitting.
Dense Layer: Outputs probability using a sigmoid function.
